## Car Price Prediction Using Neural Networks

# Introduction
This project focuses on predicting car prices using a neural network model. It aims to provide a more accurate prediction compared to traditional linear regression models. In this README, you will find a brief overview of the project, along with instructions on how to use the code.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset used for this project is stored in the 'car data.csv' file.
We begin by importing the necessary libraries and inspecting the dataset.
We perform data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical data (Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, and Transmission).
The dataset is then split into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Further, we split the data into training and test sets, and perform feature scaling using StandardScaler.

# Neural Network Architecture
We use TensorFlow and Keras to build a neural network model.
The model consists of an input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, and an output layer with a linear activation function.
The custom R-squared (R²) metric is implemented to evaluate model performance.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss function.

# Training and Evaluation
The model is trained on the training data for 500 epochs.
After training, predictions are made on the test set.
We evaluate the model using the following metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)

# Results
The neural network model significantly outperforms Lasso and Linear regression models:

Neural Network Model:

MAE: 0.544
MSE: 0.479
RMSE: 0.692
R²: 0.964

Lasso and Linear Regression Models:

MAE: 1.051
MSE: 1.698
RMSE: 1.303
R²: 0.871

# Instructions for Use

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone <repository-url>
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow seaborn
Place your car dataset in the root folder and name it 'car data.csv'.

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the neural network model.

Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture as needed for your specific dataset.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of neural networks in predicting car prices. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can apply this model to your own car price prediction tasks. Feel free to experiment with different datasets and model configurations to achieve even better results.
